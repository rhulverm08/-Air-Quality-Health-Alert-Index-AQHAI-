# -Air-Quality-Health-Alert-Index-AQHAI-
A Python-based data analysis project to evaluate air pollution levels and generate health alert scores using EDA and visual analytics.

# 🌍 Air Quality Health Alert Index (AQHAI)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Air Quality Health Alert Index (AQHAI)** is a Python-based data analysis project designed to evaluate air pollution levels and translate them into a meaningful **health risk score**.  
The project helps understand how different air pollutants impact human health and categorizes air quality into clear alert levels.

This project demonstrates **end-to-end data analysis skills**, from raw data processing to insights and visual storytelling.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze air quality data using Python
- Clean and preprocess real-world datasets
- Create a **custom health alert scoring logic**
- Categorize air quality into risk levels
- Visualize trends and insights using charts
- Present results in an easy-to-understand format

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Description
The dataset contains air quality measurements for multiple pollutants, such as:
- PM2.5
- PM10
- NO₂
- SO₂
- CO
- O₃

Each record represents pollution levels for a specific location and time period.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** – numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** – data visualization
- **Seaborn** – advanced visual analytics
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 🔄 Project Workflow
1. **Data Importing**
   - Loaded CSV data into Pandas DataFrames

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values
   - Corrected data types
   - Removed inconsistencies

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Statistical summaries
   - Pollutant distribution analysis
   - Trend analysis across regions and time

4. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created derived metrics from pollution values
   - Normalized pollutant levels

5. **Health Alert Score Calculation**
   - Designed a custom scoring logic based on pollution thresholds
   - Combined multiple pollutants into a single health score

6. **Risk Categorization**
   - Low Risk
   - Moderate Risk
   - High Risk
   - Severe Risk

7. **Data Visualization**
   - Bar charts for pollutant comparison
   - Line charts for trends
   - Donut/Pie charts for alert distribution

---

## 📊 Key Visualizations
- Pollutant concentration comparison
- Health alert score distribution
- Average health score trends
- Alert category breakdown

These visuals help convert raw data into actionable insights.

## 🚨 Health Alert Categories
| Score Range | Alert Level |
|------------|-------------|
| 0 – 50     | Low Risk    |
| 51 – 100   | Moderate    |
| 101 – 200  | High Risk   |
| 200+       | Severe      |

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- PM2.5 and PM10 have the strongest impact on health risk scores
- Certain locations consistently show higher pollution levels
- Seasonal trends affect overall air quality
- Combining pollutants gives a more realistic health assessment

---

## 📌 Conclusion
This project highlights how **data analytics can support public health awareness** by converting pollution data into understandable health alerts.  
It showcases strong fundamentals in **Python, data analysis, logic building, and visualization**, making it ideal for data analyst roles.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Integrate real-time air quality APIs
- Build an interactive dashboard using Power BI or Streamlit
- Add predictive modeling for pollution trends
- Location-based alert notifications
